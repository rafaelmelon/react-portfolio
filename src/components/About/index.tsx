            <p>Hi! I am <b>Susana Vázquez a Product Designer / UX / UI</b> in the digital world and an architect in the “real” one. I think that everything is about usability, comfort and beauty.</p>
            <p>I am creative, communicative and efficient in my daily work. I like to face new challenges so I have worked as an architect, but also as a photographer and a web designer / developer and I have lived in France and New York.</p>
            <p>I always pay attention to detail because I like things well done and I am a good listener so I can speak Spanish, Galician, English and French. Theatre and travelling are some of my passions, and I always want to try new experiences.</p>
